# Tutorial 02: HTML/CSS

Write a html file to replicate the contents of [target.png](target.png) **exactly**, and submit it by pushing to this repository. You may refer to the [tutorial notes](Tutorial-2.pdf) and any other resources you find on the internet (or elsewhere) for help. However keep in mind that directly copying code snippets from the internet is not recommended as all submissions will be run through a plagiarism checker.

The final repo should look like:

```
.
├── README.md
├── submission
│  ├── index.html
│  └── ... (other relevant files, if required)
├── target.png
└── Tutorial-2.pdf
```
